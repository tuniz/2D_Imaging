Paper Abstract:
We study full vector imaging of two dimensional source fields through finite slabs of media with extreme anisotropy, such as hyperbolic media. For this, we adapt the exact transfer matrix method for uniaxial media to calculate the two dimensional transfer functions and point spread functions for arbitrary vector fields described in Cartesian coordinates. This is more convenient for imaging simulations than the use of the natural, propagation direction-dependent TE/TM basis and clarifies which field components contribute to sub-diffraction imaging. We study the effect of ordinary waves on image quality, which previous one-dimensional approaches could not consider. Perfect sub-diffraction imaging can be achieved if longitudinal fields are measured, but in the more common case where field intensities or transverse fields are measured, ordinary waves cause artefacts. These become more prevalent when attempting to image large objects with high resolution. We discuss implications for curved hyperbolic imaging geometries such as hyperlenses.
